So, to understand what an LLM is lets decompose it and explain it a little bit here.



Suppose you have a folder called "LLM-2-70b", alright the name comes from this:
  - "LLM" is the series of models
  - "2" comes from the iteration (not sure what that means)
  - "70b" is reffers to 70 billion, and is talking about the parameter that neural network has

now, this folder has 2 files
  - paraneters
  - run.c

the parameters file is just a file with bynary values, and the run.c file is a program wrote in
the language C (why C ? well, cause is a low level language and is efficient in runtime and syntax
characters)

the run.c files must be compiled and and then run pointing at the parameters file, and with that, you
would have your model running, to this model that runs you can pass it prompts as to a normal AI model
like Chatgpt.
